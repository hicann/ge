 * @brief Stub library for constant_folding_ops (used only at build time).
 *
 * This file intentionally provides **no real implementations**.
 * It only exists so that the AIR repository can be built independently
 * without depending on the real constant_folding_ops.so produced by OPP.
 *
 * At runtime:
 *   ✅ The real libconstant_folding_ops.so (from OPP) will be loaded first.
 *   ✅ This stub library will NOT be used.
 *
 * If this stub is accidentally loaded (extremely unlikely):
 *   ✅ It still won't crash, because it exports zero symbols.
 *
 * This file is safe, minimal, and production-friendly.
